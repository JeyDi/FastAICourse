# FastAICourse
Repository of my FastAI Courses.

This is my Machine Learning and Deep learning journey to better understand and practise all the stuff related to Data Science with online courses.

There are different folders for any course (Machine Learning, Deep Learning and NLP).

There's also the official fast-ai repository that can be found here:
